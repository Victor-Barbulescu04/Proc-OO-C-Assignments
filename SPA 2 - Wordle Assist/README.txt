This project is a Wordle assist program that's designed to take in a dictionary of possible answers, the users guesses, and the feedback received from Wordle about the letters in the word. The project works as intended, reading in the words, guesses, and feedback and printing a list of possible answers. For this assignment, we were required to use only simple arrays, which led to many instances of wasted memory and inefficient runtimes. 

I acknowledge that there are many points in the program where using a vector or hash table would have been far more efficient for lookup times and space complexity. If I were to be doing this project on my own and not for a class, I would hardly use arrays at all and focus more on these two data structures instead. This implementation, although functional, is unfortunately inefficient simply due to class requirements.
