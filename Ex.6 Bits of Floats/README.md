Example program demonstrating how to extract the mantissa of a 32-bit IEEE-754 standard float representation. This program checks if the mantissa is greater than or less than/is a half. Basically, it's checking the 22nd bit (representing 1/2) to see if it's set or not. The program achieves this comparing the hexadecimal value of the inputted number to a bitmask to extract and verify the relevant bits.
