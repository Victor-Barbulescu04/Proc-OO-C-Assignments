This repo contains course work and major projects from my CSC 2210 Procedural and Object Oriented C++ course.
We don't exactly have labs in this course, so for the bigger projects take a look at any folder that starts with SPA. The Alien Hunt project is also a great project that highlights OO principles and design patterns implemented in C++ on a slightly larger scale.
